## Reference

### Command shortcuts

- **command-.** or **windows-.**: toggles preview vs. edit modes

### Saving

Your latest theme edits are saved in your browser's local storage. So,
you can refresh your window without fear of losing anything. But, if you
clear your local storage, you'll lose whatever you've done.

If you change the name of a theme, it will create a new theme with that name.
The control in the top left let's you browse your themes or create a new one.

### Sharing

The Share control near the upper left allows you to publish your theme.
This will generate a unique URL you can send
to someone. When they open that URL, they will see your work. They will not be
able to modify your version. But, they can create their own riff on yours.
